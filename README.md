## Purpose
There are many roles available in data science, and it can really confusing sometimes. This project aims to solve this problem by identifying perfect profiles for each role. In phase 1, we do qualitative analysis and create corresponding visualizations. In phase 2, we scrape Indeed job posting data to further refine the profiles.
